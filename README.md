# hw9-dci-dashboard

Project Site: https://tkadamson.github.io/hw9-dci-dashboard/

For this project, I built my own visualizations of Drum Corps International Scores by season. More info about that process can be found on the website landing page. 

The requirements for the project were as follows:
* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component. **Hint**: Bootstrap has a relatively easy way to [make tables responsive](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/#responsive-tables) but it isn't the only way.  

The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
* Is responsive such that at smaller screen sizes the navbar links are replaced by a sandwich menu. The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) (notice the background color change). Again, bootstrap has [relatively easy ways](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#toggler) to accomplish this, but it's not the only way.

Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.


All project requirements were completed. Visit site and see html code for details on how these requirements were fulfilled.
