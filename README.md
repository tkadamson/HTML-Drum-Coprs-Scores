# hw9-dci-dashboard

### Summary | GRADE: A+

This project used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a visualization dashboard. I chose to build visuals around Drum Corps International scores from 2013-2019 (the years I've been following the sport) using Matplotlib line graphs of offical score data, found here: https://www.dci.org/scores.
